# Getting Started 

Originally this API was going to connect to the OpenWeather API
 and be able to get real time weather from a country 
 that the user created but as I have never touched Node.js and Vue before 
 I had to learn it and in the little amount of time, I wasnent able to fully complete 
 what I inteded to do.

 I am still learning how to do use Node and Vue so here is what I got so far!

First make sure you make an account in Render:
- https://render.com/

And create a Database for postgress and copy the external database link and add line to the .env file where it says DATABASE_URL

- you can run both the frontend and backend through terminal by typong the command

npm run dev 

- From there you can make countries and view them in a list on the homepage of the website
